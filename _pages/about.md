I am a PhD candidate in the Economics Department at the [University of California, Riverside]([https://economics.ucr.edu/graduate-program/graduate-students/](https://economics.ucr.edu)). I study the economics of education, with a particular interest in long-run effects and intergenerational transmission. 

My research interest areas are Labor Economics, Economics of Education, Development Economics, Health Economics, and Econometrics.

Prior to coming to UCR in 2017, I completed my Master’s in Economics in India. I worked with think tanks and government research organizations as well.
