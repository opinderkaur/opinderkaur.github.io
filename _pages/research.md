**Intergenerational Health Effects of Adult Literacy Programs: Evidence from India [(Draft)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4120022)**
 
    I estimate the impact of a large-scale adult literacy program on child health. Beginning in 2009, the government of India phased in a literacy campaign targeting rural women in districts with an adult female literacy rate of 50 percent or below. I exploit this eligibility threshold in a regression discontinuity design. Using variation around the cutoff, I find mothers eligible for the program have less malnourished children, likely driven by increased labor force participation of mothers and a diverse diet intake for their children. I do not find evidence for changes in fertility behavior and utilization of healthcare services through which literacy programs might affect child health. The results translate to a large social gain induced by favorable child health outcomes, suggesting additional scope for well-designed adult literacy programs in developing countries to raise overall welfare.
   
* Does signaling college quality matter? An experimental study in India (with Sarojini Hirshleifer and Deepshikha Batheja)
*Funded by: J-PAL Post-Primary Education Fund*

  We measure the impact of two main signals of tertiary-level human capital accumulation, college quality and certification, on the first stage of the hiring process in India. We send 18,000 resumes to 1500 job postings for recent engineering graduates across eight major cities.  We find no impact on callbacks of having graduated from a mid-tier college ranked in the top 300 relative to one outside of the top 1000. There is also no impact of scoring in the highest as opposed to the lowest quartile of a widely-used certification test. We do not find evidence of gender discrimination or heterogeneity by company characteristics.
