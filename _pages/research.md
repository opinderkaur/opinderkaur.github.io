**Intergenerational health effects of adult learning programs: Evidence from India**

<!-- **Intergenerational Health Effects of Adult Learning Programs: Evidence from India** ([Job Market Paper](/files/JMP_Kaur2022.pdf)) -->

<!-- I estimate the impact of a large-scale adult learning program on child health. Beginning in 2009, the government of India phased in an education campaign targeting rural women in districts with an adult female literacy rate of 50 percent or below. I exploit the exogenous variation created by the program implementation in a regression discontinuity framework using a nationally representative household survey. I find that children whose mothers are eligible for the program are less malnourished, with improved health outcomes measured by height-for-age and weight-for-age z-scores. The results are likely driven by increased diversity in children’s diets and higher labor force participation of mothers. I do not find evidence for changes in fertility behavior and utilization of healthcare services. The results translate to a large social gain induced by favorable child health outcomes, suggesting additional scope for well-designed adult learning programs in developing countries to raise overall welfare.-->


**Teacher value-added spillovers: How far they transcend?**

<!--Good teachers affect both the short- and long-term achievements of their students. Apart from influencing their own students, teachers may also have broader impacts by increasing the performance of future peers of their students. I quantify teacher effects on such spillovers. The identification comes from the natural transitions of students from multiple elementary schools into a single middle school. I find that the positive impact of teachers on their students spills over to affect their students’ future peers with improved cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes in middle school and long-run outcomes in high school. Such unaccounted spillovers underestimate the actual effectiveness of a teacher.-->
