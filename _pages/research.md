* ["Intergenerational Health Effects of Adult Literacy Programs: Evidence from India"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4120022)
   
**Abstract**
I estimate the impact of a large-scale adult literacy program on child health. Beginning in 2009, the government of India phased in a literacy campaign targeting rural women in districts with an adult female literacy rate of 50 percent or below. I exploit this eligibility threshold in a regression discontinuity design. Using variation around the cutoff, I find mothers eligible for the program have less malnourished children, likely driven by increased labor force participation of mothers and a diverse diet intake for their children. I do not find evidence for changes in fertility behavior and utilization of healthcare services through which literacy programs might affect child health. The results translate to a large social gain induced by favorable child health outcomes, suggesting additional scope for well-designed adult literacy programs in developing countries to raise overall welfare.
